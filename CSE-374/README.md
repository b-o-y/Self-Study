# CSE-374
A class from my school that I never formally took, but have access to the material for self study.
The class covered some Linux/Shell/Bash basics, C, and C++.
All homework assignment descriptions are given in a text file in their respective folder/directory.

# What I Learned
* Learned more about shell scripting.

# Status
* I got a job, and haven't really bothered to come back to finish the course's assignments.
Doubt I ever will, since I was recently accepted to a master's program, and I have a full time
job now.
