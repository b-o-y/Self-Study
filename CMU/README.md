# CMU
Labs from Carnegie Melon based on the book Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective.
Thought they would be fun to do to learn more about computer architecture and system's
programming.

# What I Learned
* Learned a bit about C and x86

# Status
* Not working on this anymore. The bomb lab was kind of tedious, as was datalab.
Don't really care to continue.
