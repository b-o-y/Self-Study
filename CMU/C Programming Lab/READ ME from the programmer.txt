--> When I run the example command, the program fails. But if I do my own test,
with the same commands, valgrind tells me that all memory was accounted for.
I'm not sure why this discrepancy exists.

--> I believe some of the files on here are redundant, as they're from when
"make" is used for qtest.

--> In q_insert_tail I use strdup which uses malloc, yet in q_remove_head
I used strcpy with a malloc used beforehand. Only reason I used strcpy was
because I figured the amount needed to allocate memory was explicitly stated
in the instructions. Otherwise, I would've just used strdup.
